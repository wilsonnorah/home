		<h2 id="whatisfeminismheader">What is Feminism?</h2>
      <p id="whatisfeminism">
		  In its essence, feminism is the belief that all genders should have equal social, political, and economic rights and opportunities, and a movement committed to advancing gender equity. Feminists acknowledge that women are lacking opportunities, privileges, and rights in both Western and third-world countries. Misogyny is ingrained in most societies' cultures, and women and other marginalized groups are systemically oppressed because of this. We call this system of misogyny and oppression of women the patriarchy. Feminism also takes into consideration the way people may be even more oppressed by experiencing different but connected forms of discrimination. This is called intersectionality.

        <h2 id="intersectionalityheader">The Intersectionality Theory</h2>
        <p id="intersectionalityone">
		  This theory refers to the way people experience oppression from more than one direction, and how those factors affect each other. For example, a Hispanic woman living in the United States would experience both racism and sexism, separately. However, not only would she face prejudice from multiple groups, she would also have to endure stereotypes associated with, and discrimination directed specifically at, Hispanic women. That is the main idea of intersectionality. The term was coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in the 1980s. As a black woman, she experienced intersectional oppression herself, and saw it experienced by others. However, at the time, there was no name for the phenomenon, which often led to the concept being easily dismissed or ignored by figures of authority, and in legal cases. Crenshaw putting a name to it, and explaining it in her paper
			<a href="https://sph.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/Kimberle_Crenshaw_Mapping_the_Margins.pdf">&ldquo;Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence Against Women of Colour&rdquo;</a>
		led to a more widespread understanding of intersectionality and its deep impact on the many women who weren't white, as well as heterosexual, cisgender, able-bodied, and so on.

		Intersectionality is incredibly important in feminism. In simple terms, feminism that is not intersectional doesn't qualify as real feminism. Feminism must be inclusive of marginalized groups beyond just women; people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, disabled people, impoverished people, members of minority religions, and more. Feminism supports the advancement of women—<i>all</i> women, in addition to marginalized people that may not be women. There are several groups of people who are not intersectional feminists; typically indicated by exclusion of a group, most commonly women of colour or trans women, in their so-called feminism. One such example is white feminists. This refers to &ldquo;feminism&rdquo; that excludes people of colour. This may be blatant racism, or simply choosing to take the easy road by not considering the struggles of women of colour when advocating on behalf of women. Other examples include &ldquo;TERFs&rdquo; which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists. This refers to so-called feminists that are actively transphobic, typically believing that transgender women are not &ldquo;real women&rdquo;.
